# 💼 My Bio

I am a Data Scientist with a Master's in Data Science from Rice University and a Bachelor's in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from IIT Madras, with a Minor in Machine Learning and AI. My work bridges applied research and production-grade systems, with experience across academia, industry, and research labs.

I’ve built projects across domains, including:
- 🧠 Generative AI for vision and language
- 💹 Quantitative modeling for financial markets
- 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM-based systems
- 🛰️ Real-time computer vision application for satellite and aerospace applications
- 🧪 Experimental design and marketing measurement
- 📊 Big data processing with scalable cloud workflows

While anything in data science sparks my curiosity, I’m primarily interested in roles involving:
- Quantitative finance  
- Generative AI (esp. vision-language)  
- Machine learning engineering
